      <description>It is my pleasure to announce the first release of the MapStruct project!
MapStruct is a code generator which simplifies the implementation of mappings between Java bean types by generating mapping code at compile time, following a convention-over-configuration approach.
The problem In multi-layered applications there is often the need to map between objects from diffent models.
Examples include the conversion from JPA entities into data transfer or view objects and the mapping between the internal model of an application and external-facing representations such as the types of a web service facade.</description>
